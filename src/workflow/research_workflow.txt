I want to build a workflow to research on any topic in arxiv and generate a tree of related projects

I want to utlize this website to extract key data 
https://papers.cool/arxiv/


this request will get general info about paper
https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.13888

this will get AI summary of the paper
https://papers.cool/arxiv/kimi?paper=2505.13888

on the general info page, there is a button called [REL] and on click, it will run a search to get related topics

https://papers.cool/arxiv/search?query=heads,filtering,predicate,llms,filter,lms,item,reapplied,list,tasks

this url retrieves a list of papers published in given category, sorted by date desc 
https://papers.cool/arxiv/cs.RO



In this flow, I want to build 
a list of research with the name of the research and one sentence to describe what it does
