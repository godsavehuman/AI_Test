I want to build a workflow to research on any topic in arxiv and generate a tree of related projects

I want to utlize this website to extract key data 
https://papers.cool/arxiv/


this request will get general info about paper
https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.13888

this will get AI summary of the paper
https://papers.cool/arxiv/kimi?paper=2505.13888

on the general info page, there is a button called [REL] and on click, it will run a search to get related topics

https://papers.cool/arxiv/search?query=heads,filtering,predicate,llms,filter,lms,item,reapplied,list,tasks

this url retrieves a list of papers published in given category, sorted by date desc 
https://papers.cool/arxiv/cs.RO




result driven - first give requirement and expected result, then let the agent run 

In this flow, I want to build 
a list of research with the name of the research and one sentence to describe what it does 

identify 
success criteria first , what is the final result user need and how to confirm what you have meet the expectation


given a research paper 
run a comprehensive research on the paper to save info such as

name of research - one sentense description 

from the research, we want to find any 



Get all benchmark and leaderboard related to AI, robotics

I expect benchmark name and a table of leaderboard with top 5 performers 

for example 

SWE Bench - Bash Only  score
Claude 4.5 Sonnet       70.60
GPT-5                   65.00

Aider Polyglot
GPT-5 (high)            88.0%
Gemini 2.5 Pro          83.1%


GSO
Claude-4.5-Sonnet       14.7%	
GPT-5 (high)	        6.9%


the data structure should also be extensible to make it possible to compare any product/services on any given metrics
Input Cost / 1M tokens
GPT-5                   $1.25
Claude Opus 4.1         $15



        Metric 
entity  value (foramt: number, percentage, money)

make it easy to query by metric, entity can expand indefintely 
metric can have relations so we can choose to get related metrics
